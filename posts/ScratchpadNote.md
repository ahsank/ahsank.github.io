Scratchpad
==========

Sometimes I like to type notes without leaving the browser or paste some items. Scratchpad is a simple html page that leverages [showdown.js](https://showdownjs.com/) for automatic markdown preview. It even generates diagrams from plain text using [mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) (work in progress).
